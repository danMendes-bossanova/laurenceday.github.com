  <h1>Hi, Laurence Day!</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Danilo and I am a software developer with over 15 years of experience in the many languages but also 3 years of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance industry. I am currently based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a big fan of the work you are doing at Wildcat Finance. I am particularly interested in the protocol's project selection approach, which I believe is innovative and has the potential to identify high-quality projects in emerging markets.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am writing to you today to express my interest in promoting Wildcat Finance in Brazil and Latin America. I believe that Wildcat Finance has the potential to be a valuable resource for investors in these regions, and I am confident that I can help to raise awareness of the protocol and its benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a strong network of contacts in the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance industry in Brazil and Latin America. I am also fluent in Portuguese and Spanish. I am confident that I can use my skills and experience to help Wildcat Finance achieve its goals in these regions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have attached my resume for your review. I would be happy to discuss my proposal with you in more detail.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
  </p>

    Best regards,
